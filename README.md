The Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (T.E.N.S.) unit is a portable medical device that uses electrical pulses to help relieve both chronic and short-term pain. This project focuses on building a user-friendly T.E.N.S. unit that can generate different types of electric pulses using simple electronic components like integrated circuits and RC timers.

Users can adjust key settings like pulse width, frequency, and voltage depending on the type and level of pain. The device also supports two working modes — continuous and intermittent — to suit different therapy needs.

By using the Blynk mobile app and IoT integration, users can control the frequency of electric pulses from their phone based on their pain level and tolerance. Potentiometers and electrodes ensure accurate delivery of therapy. Compact components like MOSFETs and diodes make the device small, reliable, and easy to carry.

This T.E.N.S. unit can be useful in areas like physiotherapy and dentistry, offering drug-free, side-effect-free pain relief. In the future, it could be enhanced by connecting with ultrasound therapy for stronger and broader treatment options.
